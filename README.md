# acdma-crossbar
System-Verilog implementation of the ACDMA crossbar 

Aggregated Code Division Multiple Access (ACDMA) crossbar is a novel CDMA-based crossbar [1] that offers higher area, power, and throughput per area efficiency than existing CDMA and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based crossbars.
